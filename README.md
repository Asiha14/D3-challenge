# D3 Challenge

The goal of this project was to use census data to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers visualize the  findings.
The information was obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml.
